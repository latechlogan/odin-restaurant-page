          <h1 class="copy-h1">Our Story</h1>
          <p class="copy-p">
            Bloom & Brew Caf√© started with one mom‚Äôs mission: to make birthday
            cakes her daughter could actually enjoy. After too many parties with
            desserts off-limits, the kitchen turned into a lab of
            allergen-friendly experiments. Soon, friends and neighbors were
            asking for cakes too. And because coffee and cake are a perfect
            match, the bakery blossomed into a caf√©.
          </p>
          <p class="copy-p">
            Today, Bloom & Brew is still family-run, still passionate about
            delicious food, and still committed to creating a place where
            everyone can share in the joy of a treat.
