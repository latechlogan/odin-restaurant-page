        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Bloom & Brew Caf√© started with one mom‚Äôs mission: to make birthday
          cakes her daughter could actually enjoy. After too many parties with
          desserts off-limits, the kitchen turned into a lab of
          allergen-friendly experiments. Soon, friends and neighbors were asking
          for cakes too. And because coffee and cake are a perfect match, the
          bakery blossomed into a caf√©.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Bloom & Brew is still family-run, still passionate about
          delicious food, and still committed to creating a place where everyone
          can share in the joy of a treat.
